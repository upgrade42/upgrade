This website is dedicated to UPGRADE- Increasing Capacity of Participatory Youth Work, which unites organizations from Sweden, Estonia, Poland, Ukraine, and Georgia. 

The project aims to increase the operational capacity and participatory approaches of Youth Centers in partner countries through creating youth work structures, developing professional competencies of youth workers, establishing /exchanging the means of best practices.

Furthermore, it involves several stakeholders: city hall representatives, youth workers, youth organization representatives and young people who will devise a suitable, modern strategy and approach to youth centers in partner countries. Through this cross-sectoral character, the project contributes to trust-building and confidence building between the municipality and non-profit youth organizations.
