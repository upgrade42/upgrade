The project aims to increase the operational capacity and participatory approaches of Youth Centers in partner countries through creating youth work structures, developing professional competencies of youth workers, establishing /exchanging the means of best practices. </p>

Furthermore, it involves several stakeholders: city hall representatives, youth workers, youth organization representatives and young people who will devise a suitable, modern strategy and approach to youth centers in partner countries. Through this cross-sectoral character, the project contributes to trust-building and confidence building between the municipality and non-profit youth organizations. </p>
