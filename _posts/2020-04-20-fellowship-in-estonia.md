Special thanks to Jevgenia Zovmer, a youth worker who introduced us to topical non-learning and working youth programs operating in Estonia and shared their own experiences and experience in youth work.

The Center hosts: language courses, cultural evenings, meetings with famous people, sporting events, trainings for schoolchildren, tournaments, movie classes, culinary courses. Also, it collects tourist trips, organizes summer camps, cycling courses, teaches to shoot and mount films, write interesting projects and plant flowers.

It was interesting to learn about the possibility of Estonian Youth Centers to write interesting projects for young people and receive funding for the necessary equipment and equipment, in particular: creating their own recording studios with musical instruments, gym and dance hall, computer classes, virtual reality rooms, photo studios, walls for rock climbing, table tennis, billiards or football, Playstation.
