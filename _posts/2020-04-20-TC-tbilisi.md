The following days, were dedicated more on brainstorming on core principles of the youth work. Knowing about the core principles opened the discussions and participants brainstormed and came up with the cases from their own communities how the core principles are implemented in their realities. This gave possibility to draw the youth work implementation realities in each country, which made possible at first to visualize it and then compare the various realities. Even more, participants could choose principles they are lacking/need in order to improve the quality of the youth work.
